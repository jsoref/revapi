= Revapi for Java

The Java extension somewhat obviously provides API checking capability for Java libraries. It contains a large number
of checks that check different aspects of changes in the API, but it, too, is extensible. That is useful in cases where
Java methods are annotated using annotations like JPA or JAXB. One can imagine new checks on methods and fields
annotated by those annotations to perform additional analysis for DB schema changes or XML serialization changes.

== Overview

The Revapi java extension performs a thorough class and method signature analysis and detects quite a large number of
(potential) problems and changes of the code in the two versions of the API.

NOTE: There are over *80* kinds of detected changes (of which some don't represent an actual problem with the API but
merely a compatible change (a change nevertheless)).

You can find below all the detected differences, but as a sneak peak consider the following
detected changes:

* _checked exception added/removed to/from method signature_ - both of these are source incompatible but binary
compatible changes,
* _formal type parameter added to class/method signature_ - this is again source incompatible but binary compatible,
* _non-final method replaced by a final method in superclass_ - huh, binary compatible, source potentially incompatible,
potentially producing `VerifyError` at linkage time. What is this actually? V1 of the library contained a class
`C` with method `m()`. Class `C` inherited from class `B`. V2 changed this such that `C` still inherits from `B` but
method `m()` is now final and declared in `B`. This change is OK *unless* client code inherits from `C` and overrides
the method in question.
* _serialVersionUid unchanged_ - reported when there's been a change in the class that would change the automatically
generated serialization version, but the manually assigned `serialVersionUid` field remained with the same value in
the new version of the library.
* _non-public part of API_ - a class that is non-public was detected to be reachable from the public API. I.e. there
exists a non-public type that is used in a public capacity - as a return type or a parameter of an accessible method -
this is checked recursively. E.g. in the example below, the `Internal` class is flagged:
[]
```java
//------------------------ API.jar

public class API {
  public Model getModel() {
    return null;
  }
}

//------------------------ Dependency.jar

public class Model {
  protected Internal getState() {
    return null;
  }
}

/*package private*/ class Internal {
}

```
[]
This is because the api class `API` returns the `Model` class from its public method and therefore makes the `Model`
class formally part of the API even though it comes from a dependency. The `Model` class then is non-final and
returns an `Internal` instance from its method. Thus, it is conceivable that a user of the API.jar might want to
extend and use the `Model` class at which point he'd be unable to use the correct type of the `getState()` result.

== List of API Differences

When Revapi reports the found API problems it needs to pinpoint the element it is "talking about".
Therefore it assigns a one-line representation to each API element to identify it. It tries to follow the conventions of
Java syntax but needs to go beyond it to express additional information.

First, let's go through some simple examples.

  class com.example.MyClass

This somewhat obviously refers to a class called `MyClass` in the `com.example` package.

  class com.example.MyGenericClass<T extends java.lang.Number>

This again refers to the class but you can see that Revapi also includes the type parameters in the class name. Note
that the bounds of the type parameters are specified using fully qualified class names.

  interface com.example.MyInterface

Here we see that different kinds of classes are distinguished. Revapi uses `@interface` for annotation types, `enum` for
enumerations, `interface` for interfaces and `class` for ordinary classes.

  missing-class com.example.Whoops

What's this? Here, Revapi tries to convey that the class in question wasn't found anywhere on the classpath.

  method java.lang.String com.example.MyClass::myMethod(int, long)

If you are familiar with the method reference syntax in Java 8, you may guess that the above refers to a method called
`myMethod` declared in the `com.example.MyClass` class that returns a `java.lang.String` and accepts an `int` as its
first argument and a `long` as its second argument. As with classes, the type mentioned in the method identifier may
include the type parameters. The method identifier also includes the `throws` declaration if present on the method.

  parameter java.lang.String com.example.MyClass::myMethod(int, ===long===)

If Revapi needs to "talk" about a single parameter of a method, it encloses the parameter in `===`. The above therefore
identifies the second parameter of the method `myMethod`.

  field com.example.MyClass.myField

Quite intuitively, the above identifies the field called `myField` in the class `com.example.MyClass`.

  method void com.example.MySuperClass::superMethod() @ com.example.MyClass

This is again a little bit cryptic. The above identifies the method `superMethod` declared in `com.example.MySuperClass`
as seen in `com.example.MyClass`. In another words, Revapi distinguishes between a declared method and inherited method.
This is because a public method in a private class can be made "accessible" in the API if the private class is inherited
by some public class in the API.

Types::
```
class the.fully.qualified.class.name.including.Any<Type extends Params>
```
where `class` can be `class`, `interface`, `enum` or `@interface` depending on the kind of class in question, or in case
the type is missing in the API:
```
missing-class fully.qualified.class.name.including.Any<Type extends Params>
```

Methods::
Declared method:
```
method ReturnType fully.qualified.class.name.of.the.declaring.class::methodName(All, The, Params) throws Any, Exceptions
```
Inherited method:
```
method ReturnType fully.qualified.class.name.of.the.declaring.class::methodName(All, The, Params) throws Any, Exceptions @ the.class.that.inherits.the.Method
```
Revapi distinguishes between declared and inherited methods because a public method in a private class can be made
"accessible" in the API if the private class is inherited by some public class in the API.

Method Parameters::
This is where the syntax differs most from java. The `===` highlight the parameter
in question among the others. Note also that the parameter names are not available because more often than not they're
not available in the bytecode.

Parameter on a declared method:
```
parameter ReturnType class.name.of.declaring.class::methodName(===ParameterType===, Other, Params)
```
Parameter on an inherited method:
```
parameter ReturnType class.name.of.declaring.class::methodName(===ParameterType===, Other, Params) @ class.name.of.inheriting.class
```
Because method parameter is tied to the method, the distinction between a declared and inherited method is exhibited
in the identifier of the method parameter, too.

Fields::
Declared field:
```
field fully.qualified.class.name.of.declaring.class.fieldName
```
Inherited field:
```
field fully.qualified.class.name.of.declaring.class.fieldName @ class.that.inherits.the.Field
```
As with methods, the distinction between a declared and inherited field is quite important.

==== Match Parameters
In addition to a human-readable representation of the element outlined above, the differences can also be matched by
their additional parameters. Each of the below differences lists the parameters that can be matched against.

For example the `java.class.noLongerImplementsInterface` difference defines the match parameter `interface`. This can
be used when matching the difference for example in the `revapi.ignore` extension:
```javascript
{
  "regex": true,
  "code": "java\\.class\\.noLongerImplementsInterface",
  "old": "class my\\..*",
  "interface": "my\\.Interface"
}
```

The above will instruct Revapi to not report the removal of `my.Interface` from the list of implemented interfaces on
any class in the `my` package (or any other subpackage).

All types of differences report the `elementKind` parameter that can have 1 of the following values:
[cols="35s,<65d"]
|=============
|`class` | The element is an ordinary class
|`interface` | The element is an interface
|`enum` | The element is an enum class
|`@interface` | The element is an annotation class
|`constructor` | The element is a constructor
|`enumConstant` | The element is an enum constant
|`field` | The element is a field
|`method` | The method is a method
|`parameter` | The element is a method parameter
|`annotation` | The element is an annotation of another element
|=============

Additionally, if the analyzer is configured to report example use chains for given difference (see the java extension
link:extensions/java.html[configuration]), there will be 1 or 2 more parameters with the example use chains present:
`exampleUseChainInOldApi` and/or `exampleUseChainInNewApi`.

=== Detected Differences
All the differences detected by the extension are defined in the
link:../revapi-java-spi/apidocs/org/revapi/java/spi/Code.html[Code] enumeration. Below, you can find a short discussion
of each type of the difference.

==== Missing API Class
[cols="35s,<65d"]
|=============
| Code              | +java.missing.oldClass+ or +java.missing.newClass+
| Binary severity   | potentially breaking
| Source severity   | potentially breaking
| Semantic severity | NA
|=============

By default, Revapi will report any type that should belong to the API but cannot be
found neither in the API libraries themselves or in the supporting libraries. It can also be configured to ignore such
missing classes or to abort the API check altogether. If it is configured to report them (which is the default), one of
the above codes will be emitted depending on whether the missing class is found in the old version of the API or the new
one.

The missing class behavior can be configured by the `revapi.java.missing-classes` configuration property with the
possible values of `ignore`, `report` and `error`, e.g.:

[source,javascript]
----
{
    "revapi" : {
        "java" : {
            "missing-classes" : "ignore"

Reducing the visibility of an API class is a breaking change. It means that classes that could inherit or use the class
might no longer be able to. Thus a library user might face compilation errors at compile time or linkage errors at
runtime when trying to use the new version of the library.

`java.field.serialVersionUIDChanged` or `java.field.serialVersionUIDUnchanged` because for classes without
the `serialVersionUID` the default JVM method of computing the serial version is always used.

NOTE: This check is not perfect. It will not detect a serializability change of a class if a type of one of its
fields changes its serialization format. This imperfection is shared with java serialization itself though.

==== Class Is Non-Public Part of API

While this is non-breaking from the pure API compatibility point of view, it is a very strange design decision.
This means that a class that is not publicly accessible (i.e. is private or package private) is used in a public
capacity (i.e. return type of a method, type of a method parameter, type of an accessible field, implemented interface).

By default, Revapi even outputs the "usage chain" from some public API element to the non-public class.

The check is done only on a new version of the API. It serves little purpose to report this on the old which has already
been released, while the new one might still not be out in the wild. It does make sense though to accept that some parts
of the API use non-public classes, because such API has already existed. Therefore, you can configure Revapi to only
report new violations but let the old ones be. The default behavior is to always report non-public class in the API even
if it existed in the old version (the `reportUnchanged` attribute below defaults to `true`) but you can override it as
such:

```xml
<revapi.java>
  <checks>
    <nonPublicPartOfAPI>
      <reportUnchanged>false</reportUnchanged>
    </nonPublicPartOfAPI>
  </checks>
</revapi.java>
```

or

```
{
  "extension": "revapi.java",
  "configuration": {
    "checks": {
      "nonPublicPartOfAPI": {
        "reportUnchanged": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

NOTE: This is NOT reported on a non-accessible class that is used solely as a super class of another API classes or that
is only implemented by other API classes. An implementation of a private interface or inheriting from a non-public
super class is a valid design decision.

The checked class inherits from a generic class. The type parameters used on the generic super class changed between old
and new version. Because of type erasure, this might not cause any binary incompatibility (but it can) and it can
potentially break the compilation, too.

This is generally a quite dangerous thing to do, because it can change the erased signatures of the methods or fields
inherited from the super class (which would be the cause of the binary and source incompatibilities).

An accessible static final field (i.e. a constant) was removed from the class. This breaks compilation but actually
causes no problem at runtime (i.e. when the new API is swapped for the old API without recompiling the users of the

This is reported on the `serialVersionUID` fields of classes that didn't change between the versions even though the
default UIDs would be different for the two versions of the the class. While this doesn't break the compilation nor does
it break binary compatibility, it possibly may cause semantic problems because serialization may misbehave. This
depends on if and how the `readObject` and `writeObject` methods on the class are implemented, which is beyond the scope
of this check.

The behavior of this check can be configured using the `revapi.java.checks.serialVersionUID.changeDetection`
configuration attribute. The default value of this attribute is `structural` meaning that the difference is reported
only for classes that somehow change structurally between versions (i.e. a field is added/deleted or its type changed).
When specifying `jvm` as the change detection algorithm the default serialVersionUID is computed for both old and new
version of the class. This is more "sensitive" than the structural change because it also considers any changes to
methods or static fields of the class (but it nevertheless is the algorithm that the JVM itself uses for computing the
default serialization UID of a class).

Example of the configuration in both XML and JSON:

```
<revapi.java>
  <checks>
    <serialVersionUID>
      <changeDetection>structural</changeDetection>
    </serialVersionUID>
  </checks>
</revapi.java>
```

or

```

  "extension": "revapi.java",
  "configuration": {
    "checks": {
      "serialVersionUID": {
        "changeDetection": "jvm"

This is reported as a breaking change because it is assumed that if a class is serializable it actually is
serialized and deserialized. Changing the value of the `serialVersionUID` static field causes the new class to no longer
be able to deserialize objects that were serialized using the old version of the class.

This check can be configured the same way as <<Field serialVersionUID Unchanged>>.

This is only relevant on annotation types, of which the attributes are represented by method declarations.
Changing a default value is both source and binary compatible but might cause a semantic incompatibility (depending on
how the annotation is used). Elements annotated using this annotation that didn't provide an explicit value for this
attribute will suddenly be understood to have the new default value of the attribute when used with the new version of
the API. This might or might not be a problem.

An annotation attribute no longer declares a default value. This is source incompatible change because elements
annotated without explicitly specifying the value for the attribute will no longer compile. This also breaks semantics
because annotation processor that relies on the new version of the annotation type will break with a user library that
was compiled against the old version of the API (and therefore didn't have to declare the default value of the
attribute).

This is a source-incompatible change because all implementations that were written against the old version of the
interface will not have the implementation of the new method and therefore will not compile.

On contrary, this is binary compatible, because no code that used the old version of the interface could have called
the method through the interface. The linker doesn't check for missing method implementations so the linkage also goes
without a problem.

There might be semantic problems though. It might break in situations where the interface serves the purpose of an SPI -
a library declares an SPI interface to be implemented by users and then
uses these SPI implementations inside the library. If the new version of the library assumes that the SPI
implementations provide the impl of the new method and it is provided with the SPI implementation of the old version
of the interface, things will break with `NoSuchMethodError` when the caller tries to call the SPI method backed by the
old SPI implementation.

While technically a variant of <<a_method_added_to_interface, Method Added To Interface>>, this is similar in
consequences to <<a_default_value_removed_from_method, Default Value Removed From Method>>. This is not binary
incompatible, there can be no code compiled against the previous version of the API that would try to access or use
the new attribute in any way. This is source incompatible though, because any code that declares annotations
according to the old version of the API will fail to compile against the new version of the API because it will not
define explicit value for the new attribute. This also breaks semantics because any element annotated without such
attribute won't be possible to process using a processor that depends on the new version of the API and therefore
assumes an explicit value for the annotation attribute.

list but the new version of the API suggests it is not possible. Everything will still work correctly, but new user code
might start assuming uniform types in the list).

== Class/Package Filtering

Given Java's lacking modularity (prior to Java9), authors are often forced to make classes that are essentially an
implementation detail of a library public. Such classes are often included in packages like `impl` or `internal` to
hint at their non-public nature.

While Revapi offers the basic filtering capabilities using the
link:../../revapi-basic-features/extensions/filter.html[basic filter], it is often  simpler to exclude classes or
packages using this class / package filters specifically made for this
purpose (if for nothing else then for the simpler configuration).

By default, all classes are included. If the include filter is specified, only the classes matching the include
filter are included in the API check. The exclude filter can take out classes that would otherwise be included.

It is not possible include class that matches a class exclude filter (i.e. if include and exclude filter match the same
class, the class is not included) but it is possible to include an inner classes while its parent class is excluded.

It is not possible include classes in package that matches a package exclude filter (i.e. if include and exclude filter
match the same package, the classes are not included).

=== Sample Configuration

```javascript
{
  "revapi": {
    "java": {
      "missing-classes": {
        "behavior": "report",
        "ignoreMissingAnnotations": false
      },
      "reportUsesFor": ["java.missing.newClass", "java.class.nonPublicPartOfAPI"],
      "filter": {
        "classes": {
          "regex": true,
          "include": ["com\\.acme\\.api\\..*"]
          "exclude": ["com\\.acme\\.api\\.WeRegretWePlacedThisInApi"]
        },
        "packages": {
          "regex": true,
          "include": ["com\\.acme\\.api\\..*"]
          "exclude": ["com\\.acme\\.internal"]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

=== Properties

`missing-classes.behavior`::
This tells the checker what to do when a class is found in the API that is not found in any of the provided jars. The
possible values are: `error`, `ignore` or `report` (the default). If `report` is chosen then the missing class is
reported as a problem with either `java.missing.oldClass` code or `java.missing.newClass` depending on whether the
class was found missing in the old or new version of the API.
`missing-classes.ignoreMissingAnnotations`::
If `true` (the default is `false`) the usage chain of annotation classes will not be tracked.
The end result of this is that annotation classes will not be considered part of the API and thus missing annotation
classes will not be reported.
`reportUsesFor`::
Revapi is able to track usage chains of the classes it finds in the API. For some (or all) problems you may want to know
how and where a certain class is used to be able to determine if that's something wrong or not. This configuration
property can either be a string `all-differences`, signifying that an example use chain will be reported for every found
difference or a list of difference codes for which the example use chain should be produced. By default the usage
chains are reported for the following problem codes: `java.missing.newClass`, `java.missing.oldClass`,
`java.class.nonPublicPartOfAPI`, `java.class.externalClassNoLongerExposedInAPI`, `java.class.externalClassExposedInAPI`.
`filter.classes.regex`::
Specifies whether to consider the strings in `exclude` and `include` lists as regular expressions or not. The default
value is `false`, meaning the strings are not considered as regular expressions.
`filter.classes.exclude`::
List of strings representing FQCNs or regular expressions matching FQCNs. Classes with the matching fully qualified
names (and the members of those classes) will be excluded from the API check.
`filter.classes.include`::
List of strings representing FQCNs or regular expressions matching FQCNs. Only classes with the matching fully qualified
names (and their members) will be included in the API check.
`filter.packages.regex`::
Specifies whether to consider the strings in `exclude` and `include` lists as regular expressions or not. The default
value is `false`, meaning the strings are not considered as regular expressions.
`filter.packages.exclude`::
List of strings representing full package names or regular expressions matching them. Classes with the matching package
names (and the members of those classes) will be excluded from the API check.
`filter.packages.include`::
List of strings representing full package names or regular expressions matching them. Classes with the matching package
names (and the members of those classes) will be included in the API check.

=== Notes

Contrary to intuition, java packages are not hierarchical, even though they have hierarchical names. In Java parlance,
package `com.acme.foo` is a sub-package of `com.acme` but that does not mean that it's enclosing element is
`com.acme`. No, each package is a top level element that does not have any parent elements and which only contains
classes, not other packages.

Therefore if you want to exclude a package and all its sub-packages, you need to use a regular expression
`"com\\.acme(\\..+)?"` which will match the `com.acme` package and any of its sub-packages.

== Filtering based on annotations

*Extension*: `revapi.java.filter.annotated`

The annotated element filter is able to include or exclude java elements based on the presence of certain annotation
on them. This also works for annotations with certain attributes having certain values, because the match is done on
the "standard" annotation textual notation.

If no `include` filter is specified, all elements are included, otherwise only the elements annotated with one of the
`included` annotations are API checked.

The `exclude` filter narrows down the included elements - i.e. if an element is to be included according to the
include filter (or lack thereof), the exclude filter is consulted whether that really should be the case.

If an element is included, all its child elements are included, too. I.e. if a class is included, all its methods,
fields and inner classes are included in the analysis, too (if you need to exclude some child element that would be
included by default, you can either annotate it with some annotation and configure this filter to exclude such
elements, or you can use some other Revapi filter, like
link:../../revapi-basic-features/extensions/filter.html[configurable element filter]).

NOTE: Currently, this filter does NOT take into account annotations placed on the packages.

=== Sample Configuration

```javascript
[
  {
    "extension": "revapi.java.filter.annotated",
    "configuration": {
      "regex": true,
      "include": ["@my\\.annotations\\.Public.*"],
      "exclude": ["@my\\.annotations\\.Beta"]
    }
  }
]
```

```xml
<analysisConfiguration>
  <revapi.java.filter.annotated>
    <regex>true</regex>
    <include>
      <item>@my\.annotations\.Public.*</item>
    </include>
    <exclude>
      <item>@my\.annotations\.Beta</item>
    </exclude>
  </revapi.java.filter.annotated>
</analysisConfiguration>
```

=== Properties
`regex`::
Specifies whether to consider the strings in `exclude` and `include` lists as regular expressions or not. The default
value is `false`, meaning the strings are not considered as regular expressions.
`exclude`::
Elements annotated with annotation that matches at least one from this list will be excluded from the API check.
`include`::
Elements annotated with annotation that matches at least one from this list will be included from the API check.

=== Notation
The string formatting of the annotations with values follows that of Java8. Notably:

* The full canonical class names are used for every type.
* If the annotation specifies only the value of the `value` attribute, the name, `value`, must not be included in the
 notation. I.e. `@java.lang.annotation.Retention(java.lang.annotation.RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)`, not
 `@java.lang.annotation.Retention(value = java.lang.annotation.RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)`.
* Array attributes are always enclosed in curly braces even if only a single element is present, i.e. `@java.lang
.annotation.Target({java.lang.annotation.ElementType.METHOD})`, not
`@java.lang.annotation.Target(java.lang.annotation.ElementType.METHOD)`.
* Equals sign is always surrounded by a single space from each side.

=== Examples

Let's consider the following classes in our API, that we want to filter:

```java
@Public
public class MyAPI {

   public static final int CONSTANT = 42;

   public void method() {
   }

   public static class InnerAPI {
   }

   @Private
   public static class InnerImplementation {
   }
}

@Private
public class Implementation {

    public static final int DETAIL = 43;

    @Public
    public void method() {
    }
}


public class JustAClass {

    public void method() {
    }

    @Private
    public void implMethod() {
    }

    @Public
    public void definitelyAPIMethod() {
    }
}
```

Given the classes above, the following example configurations will show different ways of setting up the filtering to
achieve anticipated results.

NOTE: The `@Public` and `@Private` annotations are not defined by Revapi. They just represent any annotation you may
choose to be used in their place for the same purpose.

==== Leave out only `@Private` Elements

This one of the simple approaches. You don't want to sprinkle your code with annotations everywhere - most of your
classes are to be considered public but you want to make sure that certain classes are not meant for public
consumption. You neither use Java 9, nor you mandate execution in some of the modular classloading frameworks like
OSGi or JBoss Modules, so your options are limited in terms of visibility and you might not have other choice but to
make even these classes public.

If you configure Revapi like this:

```javascript
[
  {
    "extension": "revapi.java.filter.annotated",
    "configuration": {
      "exclude": ["@my.annotations.Private"]
    }
  }
]
```

The API analysis will not consider these elements:

* `MyAPI.InnerImplementation` class
* `Implementation` class and any of its members
* `JustAClass.implMethod()` method

All other elements will be included in the analysis.

==== Only Consider `@Public` Elements

This is an approach where you want to have strict control over what is considered public API and what is not. You do
this by annotating the elements to be considered part of the public API using the `@Public` annotation (of your own
making).

The Revapi configuration for this might include this snippet:

```javascript
[
  {
    "extension": "revapi.java.filter.annotated",
    "configuration": {
      "include": ["@my.annotations.Public"]
    }
  }
]
```

The API analysis will not consider these elements:

* `Implementation` class and all its members but the `method()` method
* `JustAClass` class and all its members but the `definitelyAPIMethod()` method

The following elements will be analyzed:

* `MyAPI` class and all its members, including the `InnerImplementation` class
* `Implementation.method()` method
* `JustAClass.definitelyAPIMethod()` method

The `Implementation` class is not included in the API analysis, because it's not annotated by the `@Public`
annotation. On the other hand, the `MyAPI.InnerImplementation` class *is* included in the API analysis, because it is
a member of the the `MyAPI` class, which is annotated with `@Public` and there is no configuration for exclusion.

Similarly, `JustAClass` and its members are not included, because they are not annotated by `@Public`.

The situation with `Implementation.method()` and `JustAClass.definitelyAPIMethod()` is actually quite similar. In
both, the presence of the `@Public` annotation overrides the decision about the parent element's exclusion (this
decision is based on the lack of the `@Public` annotation on the parents).

Doing this might not seem particularly useful but there are scenarios, where it might be. Imagine that over the
evolution of your library certain users became reliant on an implementation class that you never meant to be public.
Over the time, you marked your certain methods or the whole class as `@Private` to really discourage users from using
them yet you know of the importance of some method in the class that your clients depend on and don't want to break
the clients using it. You thus annotate it `@Public` even though it is in a non-public class.

==== Precise Control Using Both `@Public` and `@Private`

This is of course a combination of both the approaches above but still is worth its own explanation.

The configuration would look something like this:

```javascript
[
  {
    "extension": "revapi.java.filter.annotated",
    "configuration": {
      "include": ["@my.annotations.Public"],
      "exclude": ["@my.annotations.Private"]
    }
  }
]
```

And the following elements will not be included in the analysis:

* `MyAPI.InnerImplementation` class (and all of its members, if there were any)
* `Implementation` class and all its members but the `method()` method
* `JustAClass` and all its members but the `definitelyAPIMethod()` method

This is the most "intuitive" result and probably the one the author of the library anticipated when they annotated
the methods and classes with the annotations.

== Handling Other Types of Archives

Revapi understands JAR files. But java-based applications are not deployed just as JAR files. There are other types of
artifacts like WAR files, EAR files, Spring Boot fat jars, etc. While these usually don't have any Java API as such that
would be reusable in other Java code (i.e. such non-jar archives usually cannot function as libraries) and thus
performing API checks might not be that crucial on them, it still might be useful to perform the API check on such
archives (for whatever reason, you, my dear user, know best).

Since `revapi-java-spi-0.18.0` (used in `revapi-java-0.19.0`) the API check can be extended by `JarExtractor`
implementations that can transform certain archives into "plain" JAR structure that Revapi will understand. See the
link:../revapi-java-spi/index.html[SPI] documentation for more details.

=== Handling WAR Archives

`revapi-java` by default contains an implementation of `JarExtractor` that makes it
understand the structure of WAR files and automatically assume classes from `WEB-INF/classes` as the classes of the
archive (i.e. If any archive contains a directory called `/WEB-INF/classes/` it is automatically assumed that it is a
WAR archive and only the contents of `/WEB-INF/classes/` is considered for API checks.

The behavior of the WAR extractor is configurable. The below is the default configuration:

```xml
<revapi.java>
  <extract>
    <war>
      <disabled>false</disabled> <.>
      <scan>
        <item> <.>
          <archive>.*</archive> <.>
          <prefixes>
            <item>/WEB-INF/classes/</item> <.>
          </prefixes>
        </item>
      </scan>
    </war>
  </extract>
</revapi.java>
```

<1> The WAR file detection and extraction can be disabled (it is enabled by default)
<2> There can be many ways to extract classes from different WAR archives
<3> To limit how and what is extracted from different archives, you can specify a regex on the archive name
<4> And specify a list of path prefixes that are supposed to contain the "significant" classes for the archive

Given the above default configuration, you can see that the WAR extractor looks at all archives and if it finds any
files under `/WEB-INF/classes/` the classes from there are the only ones considered during the API analysis.

== SPI

The Java extension can be augmented through its small link:../revapi-java-spi/index.html[SPI]. Check it out for some
examples on how to extend the functionality of the java checker by providing new checks or making it understand new
kinds of archives.
