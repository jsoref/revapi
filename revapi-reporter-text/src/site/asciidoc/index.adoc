== Text Reporter

*Extension*: `revapi.reporter.text`

This extension is used as a basic means of outputting the results of analysis as text to some file or standard output.

The format of the text can be configured using a http://freemarker.org[FreeMarker] template.

=== Usage

Revapi needs to be configured to use this extension, it is not present by default. In case of maven plugin, you need to
add the extension as a dependency of the maven plugin like so:

```xml
<build>
  ...
  <plugin>
    <groupId>org.revapi</groupId>
    <artifactId>revapi-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>...</version>
    <dependencies>
      <dependency>
        <groupId>org.revapi</groupId>
        <artifactId>revapi-reporter-text</artifactId>
        <version>...</version>
      </dependency>
      ...
    </dependencies>
    <configuration>
      <analysisConfiguration>
        <revapi.reporter.text>
          ... configure the extension here ...
        </revapi.reporter.text>
      </analysisConfiguration>
    </configuration>
  </plugin>
  ...
</build>
```

=== Sample Configuration

```javascript
[
  {
    "extension": "revapi.reporter.text",
    "configuration": {
      "minSeverity": "POTENTIALLY_BREAKING",
      "output" : "out",
      "template": "my-template.ftl",
      "append": false
    }
  }
]
```

```xml
<analysisConfiguration>
  <revapi.reporter.text>
    <minSeverity>POTENTIALLY_BREAKING</minSeverity>
    <output>out</output>
    <template>my-template.ftl</template>
    <append>false</append>
  </revapi.reporter.text>
</analysisConfiguration>
```

=== Properties

`minSeverity`::
The minimum severity of problems that will be included in the output. If not specified, defaults to
`POTENTIALLY_BREAKING`. Possible values are `NON_BREAKING`, `POTENTIALLY_BREAKING` and `BREAKING`.
`output`::
The path to the output file. Two special values are recognized: `out` (which is the default value of this property) and
`err` which represent standard output or standard error output respectively.
`template`::
A relative path to a FreeMarker template to format the output with. If not specified a built-in simple template is used.
`append`::
Whether to append to the chosen output or whether to overwrite it (doesn't make sense for standard (error) output).
The default value is `false` meaning the output file will be overwritten if it already exists.

=== Example Template

This is actually the default template used by the extension if you don't configure your own template.

```ftl
Old API: <#list analysis.oldApi.archives as archive>${archive.name}<#sep>, </#list> <1>
New API: <#list analysis.newApi.archives as archive>${archive.name}<#sep>, </#list>
<#list reports as report> <2>
old: ${report.oldElement!"<none>"}
new: ${report.newElement!"<none>"}
<#list report.differences as diff>
${diff.code}<#if diff.description??>: ${diff.description}</#if>
<#list diff.classification?keys as compat>${compat}: ${diff.classification?api.get(compat)}<#sep>, </#list> <3>
</#list>
<#sep>

</#sep>
</#list>
```
<1> The analysis configuration is made available in the `analysis` variable which is an object with type
link:../revapi/apidocs/org/revapi/AnalysisContext.html[`AnalysisContext`].
<2> The results of the analysis are made available to the template in the `reports` variable which is a list of
link:../revapi/apidocs/org/revapi/Report.html[`Report`] objects.
<3> The `classification` map of a difference uses an enum as a key. To be able to access the values by keys, one has to
use the `?api` construct and use the native method to access the value. Using `classification[compat]` is not possible
in the example above. This is a limitation of FreeMarker.

== FreeMarker Configuration

If you're going to use your custom template, you will need to how the FreeMarker configuration used for rendering the
template.

* The compatibility level is set to version `2.3.23`.
* The default object wrapper is used and is configured to expose public fields in addition to bean properties.
* The API built-ins are enabled (i.e. you can use ?api to access the methods of the underlying object).
* There are 2 template loaders:
** for templates from `/META-INF` using the classloader of the extension,
** for templates anywhere on the filesystem (either relative to the current path or using an absolute path) (note that
this is not the default FreeMarker's `FileTemplateLoader` which enforces some security restrictions useful in web
application environment but which are not desirable in our usecase).
